# Voice-Assistant
# Built a personal project named voice assistant using Python language. This project uses voice recognition system, language processing algorithm and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant information or perform specific operations or functions as required by the user. 
For building this project, I have used several Python libraries like pyttx3 library for text to speech conversion, speech_recognition library for converting spoken words to text,  webbrowser library for searching through web, etc. 
Used several Python libraries like:
# pyttx3 library for text to speech conversion
# speec_recognition library for converting spoken words to text
# webbrowser library for searching through web
# datetime library for function to deal with dates, time and intervals.
# pyjokes library for creating jokes
# os library provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
